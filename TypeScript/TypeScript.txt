TypeScript is a static type checker for JavaScript. This means that it will check for issues in your codebase 
using the information available on different types. 
Example: a String will have a toLowerCase() method, but not a parseInt() method. 
Of course, the type system of TypeScript can be extended with your own type definitions.

As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, you can start using it by literally just renaming your .js files to .ts, 
so you can introduce TypeScript gradually to your teams.

Note: TypeScript won't do anything in runtime, it works only during compilation time. 
You will run pure JavaScript files.

To install
	$ npm install -g typescript

To Compile:
	tsc file.ts
