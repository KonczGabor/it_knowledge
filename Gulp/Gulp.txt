Gulp solves the problem of repetition. Many of the tasks that web developers find themselves doing over and over on a daily basis can be simplified by becoming automated. Automating repetitive tasks = more time to do non repetitive tasks = more productivity.

Gulp is a javascript task runner that lets you automate tasks such as…

Bundling and minifying libraries and stylesheets.
Refreshing your browser when you save a file.
Quickly running unit tests
Running code analysis
Less/Sass to CSS compilation
Copying modified files to an output directory
