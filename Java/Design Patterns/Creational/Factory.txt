Factory is simply an object that returns another object from some other method call, which is assumed to be "new".

In this problem, you are given an interface Food. There are two classes Pizza and Cake which implement the Food interface, and they both contain a method getType().

The main function in the Main class creates an instance of the FoodFactory class. The FoodFactory class contains a method getFood(String) that returns a new instance of Pizza or Cake according to its parameter.

import java.util.*;

interface Food {
	 public String getType();
	}
	class Pizza implements Food {
	 public String getType() {
	 return "Someone ordered a Fast Food!";
	 }
	}

	class Cake implements Food {

	 public String getType() {
	 return "Someone ordered a Dessert!";
	 }
	}
	class FoodFactory {
		public Food getFood(String order) {

switch (order){
     case "pizza": return new Pizza();
     case "cake" : return new Cake();
     default : return null;
}
