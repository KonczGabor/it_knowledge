•syntax is C-like syntax, which has blocks
•usually a block creates a scope
•but not in JavaScript, where we have function scope (later)
•in other languages it's usually beneficial to define a variable at the latest moment it's possible, for JavaScript they should be at the top of each function
•in JS all parameters and variables defined in a function is not visible from outside
•and also means if a variable defined in a function, it's visible everywhere in the function

varfoo = function ( ) {
	vara = 3, b = 5;
	varbar = function ( ) {
		varb = 7, c = 11;
		// At this point, a is 3, b is 7, and c is 11
		a += b + c;
		// At this point, a is 21, b is 7, and c is 11
	};
	// At this point, a is 3, b is 5, and c is not defined
	bar( );
	// At this point, a is 21, b is 5
};
